# Mathematical Prerequisites: Foundations for Linear Algebra and Calculus

## 1. Propositional Logic

### 1.1 Statements and Truth Values
A **statement** (or **proposition**) is a declarative sentence that is unequivocally either **true (T)** or **false (F)**.

**Examples of Statements:**
- A: "4 is an even number." (T)
- B: "15 is divisible by 7." (F) 
- C: "The square root of 2 is irrational." (T)

Sentences like "Let's go!" or "What is your name?" are not statements because they cannot be assigned a truth value.

### 1.2 Logical Operators
Simple statements can be combined using **logical operators** to form **compound statements**. The truth value of a compound statement depends entirely on the truth values of its components and the connective used. This is systematically analyzed using **truth tables**.

**Primary Operators:**
- **¬ (NOT):** Negation. It reverses the truth value.
- **∧ (AND):** Conjunction. A ∧ B is true only if **both** A and B are true.
- **∨ (OR):** Disjunction. A ∨ B is true if **at least one** of A or B is true. This is the "inclusive or".
- **⇒ (IMPLIES):** A ⇒ B means "if A, then B". It is false **only** when A is true and B is false. If A is false, the implication is considered true by convention (*"ex falso quodlibet"* - from falsehood, anything follows).
- **⇔ (IF AND ONLY IF):** Equivalence. A ⇔ B is true when A and B have the **same** truth value.

**Truth Table:**
| A | B | A ∧ B | A ∨ B | A ⇒ B | A ⇔ B |
|---|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| T | T | T     | T     | T     | T     |
| T | F | F     | T     | F     | F     |
| F | T | F     | T     | T     | F     |
| F | F | F     | F     | T     | T     |

### 1.3 Tautologies, Paradoxes and Logical Equivalence
Some compound statements are special because their truth value is independent of their components.

- A **Tautology** is a statement that is **always true**. 
  Example: ¬A ∨ A (The Law of the Excluded Middle)
- A **Paradox** or **Contradiction** is a statement that is **always false**.
  Example: ¬A ∧ A

Two statements are **logically equivalent** (A ⇔ B) if they have identical truth tables. If A and B are equivalent, then A ⇔ B is a **tautology**.

### 1.4 Fundamental Logical Rules
Several equivalence rules allow us to simplify and manipulate logical expressions.

- **Commutativity:** A ∧ B ⇔ B ∧ A and A ∨ B ⇔ B ∨ A
- **Associativity:** (A ∧ B) ∧ C ⇔ A ∧ (B ∧ C) and (A ∨ B) ∨ C ⇔ A ∨ (B ∨ C)
- **Distributivity:** A ∧ (B ∨ C) ⇔ (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) and A ∨ (B ∧ C) ⇔ (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)
- **De Morgan's Laws:** ¬(A ∧ B) ⇔ ¬A ∨ ¬B and ¬(A ∨ B) ⇔ ¬A ∧ ¬B
- **Double Negation:** ¬(¬A) ⇔ A
- **Implication:** (A ⇒ B) ⇔ (¬A ∨ B)

### 1.5 Crucial Implications and Proof Techniques
The relationship between implication and equivalence is fundamental to mathematical proof.

- **Equivalence of Implication and Contrapositive:**
  (A ⇒ B) ⇔ (¬B ⇒ ¬A)
  
  This means "If it rains, the street is wet" is logically equivalent to "If the street is not wet, it did not rain". Proving the contrapositive is often an easier way to prove an original statement.

- **Equivalence and Implication:**
  (A ⇔ B) ⇔ (A ⇒ B) ∧ (B ⇒ A)
  
  This is a vital proof strategy. To prove A and B are equivalent, you prove **both** A ⇒ B (A is sufficient for B) and B ⇒ A (B is sufficient for A, or A is necessary for B).

- **Transitivity:**
  (A ⇒ B) ∧ (B ⇒ C) ⇒ (A ⇒ C) and (A ⇔ B) ∧ (B ⇔ C) ⇒ (A ⇔ C)
  
  This allows us to build complex proofs through a chain of simpler implications or equivalences.

- **Proof by Contradiction:**
  To prove A ⇒ B, assume A ∧ ¬B and show this leads to a contradiction.
  This works because (A ⇒ B) ⇔ ¬(A ∧ ¬B)

### 1.6 Predicate Logic and Quantifiers
Propositional logic deals with whole statements. **Predicate logic** introduces more granularity with variables and quantifiers.

- **Variables:** x, y, z, ...
- **Predicates:** P(x), Q(x,y), ... which become statements when variables are substituted
- **Quantifiers:**
  - ∀: "For all" (The Universal Quantifier)
  - ∃: "There exists" (The Existential Quantifier)
  - ∃!: "There exists exactly one" or "There exists a unique"

**Negation Rules for Quantifiers:**
- ¬(∀x: P(x)) ⇔ ∃x: ¬P(x)
- ¬(∃x: P(x)) ⇔ ∀x: ¬P(x)

**Important:** The **order of quantifiers** matters!
- ∀k∈ℤ ∃l∈ℤ: l ≤ k is **true** (for every integer, there's a smaller or equal one)
- ∃l∈ℤ ∀k∈ℤ: l ≤ k is **false** (there's no single integer ≤ every integer)

**Quantifiers over Sets:**
- ∀x∈M: P(x) ⇔ ∀x: (x∈M ⇒ P(x))
- ∃x∈M: P(x) ⇔ ∃x: (x∈M ∧ P(x))

## 2. Set Theory

### 2.1 Basic Concepts and Russell's Paradox
A **set** is a collection of distinct objects called **elements**. 

**Notation:** x ∈ M means "x is an element of M"

**Russell's Paradox** shows that the naive conception of sets (any collection defined by a property) leads to contradictions:
- R = {x: x ∉ x} leads to R ∈ R ⇔ R ∉ R
- This motivated the development of **axiomatic set theory**

**Important Sets:**
- ∅ or {}: the empty set
- ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}: natural numbers
- ℕ₀ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}: natural numbers with zero
- ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}: integers
- ℚ = {p/q: p ∈ ℤ ∧ q ∈ ℤ \ {0}}: rational numbers
- ℝ: real numbers
- ℂ = {x + iy: x, y ∈ ℝ}: complex numbers

### 2.2 Set Operations and Relations
- **Subset:** A ⊆ B ⇔ ∀x: x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B
- **Proper Subset:** A ⊂ B ⇔ A ⊆ B ∧ A ≠ B
- **Equality:** A = B ⇔ A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A
- **Intersection:** A ∩ B = {x: x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}
- **Union:** A ∪ B = {x: x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}
- **Disjoint Union:** A ∪ B when A ∩ B = ∅ (sometimes written A ⊍ B)
- **Difference:** A \ B = {x: x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B}
- **Complement:** If A ⊆ U (universe), then Aᶜ = U \ A
- **Power Set:** 𝒫(A) = {M: M ⊆ A} (set of all subsets of A)
- **Cartesian Product:** A × B = {(a, b): a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}

For families of sets (Aᵢ)ᵢ∈ᴵ with index set I:
- **Union:** ∪ᵢ∈ᴵ Aᵢ = {x: ∃i∈I: x ∈ Aᵢ}
- **Intersection:** ∩ᵢ∈ᴵ Aᵢ = {x: ∀i∈I: x ∈ Aᵢ}

### 2.3 Important Rules
- **De Morgan's Laws:** (A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ and (A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ
- **Distributive Laws:** A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) and A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** For finite sets: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
- **Power Set Cardinality:** For finite A: |𝒫(A)| = 2^{|A|}

## 3. Relations and Functions

### 3.1 Relations
A **relation** R between sets X and Y is a subset of X × Y. We write xRy for (x,y) ∈ R.

**Properties of Relations on a Set X:**
- **Reflexive:** ∀x ∈ X: xRx
- **Symmetric:** ∀x,y ∈ X: xRy ⇒ yRx
- **Antisymmetric:** ∀x,y ∈ X: (xRy ∧ yRx) ⇒ x = y
- **Transitive:** ∀x,y,z ∈ X: (xRy ∧ yRz) ⇒ xRz

**Inverse Relation:** R⁻¹ = {(y,x): (x,y) ∈ R}

### 3.2 Equivalence Relations
A relation is an **equivalence relation** if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

**Examples:**
- Equality (=) on any set
- Congruence modulo m: x ≡ y mod m ⇔ m ∣ (x - y)

Every equivalence relation partitions its set into **equivalence classes**: [a] = {x ∈ X: x ∼ a}

**Properties:**
- [a] = [b] if a ∼ b
- [a] ∩ [b] = ∅ if a ≁ b
- The set of equivalence classes X/∼ is called the **quotient set**

### 3.3 Order Relations
A **partial order** is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

**Examples:**
- ≤ on ℝ (total order)
- ⊆ on 𝒫(A) (partial order)
- Lexicographic order

A **total order** is a partial order where every two elements are comparable.

### 3.4 Functions
A **function** f: X → Y is a relation where each x ∈ X is related to exactly one y ∈ Y.

**Notation:** y = f(x) where y is the **image** of x, and x is a **preimage** of y.

**For A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y:**
- **Image:** f(A) = {f(x): x ∈ A}
- **Preimage:** f⁻¹(B) = {x ∈ X: f(x) ∈ B}

**Properties:**
- **Injective (one-to-one):** ∀x₁,x₂ ∈ X: f(x₁) = f(x₂) ⇒ x₁ = x₂
- **Surjective (onto):** ∀y ∈ Y ∃x ∈ X: f(x) = y
- **Bijective:** Both injective and surjective

**Special Functions:**
- **Identity:** idₓ: X → X, idₓ(x) = x
- **Inclusion:** iₐ: A → X, iₐ(x) = x for A ⊆ X
- **Restriction:** f|ₐ: A → Y, f|ₐ(x) = f(x) for A ⊆ X
- **Characteristic Function:** For B ⊆ A, χ_B: A → {0,1}, χ_B(x) = 1 if x ∈ B, 0 otherwise

**Composition:** (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))

**Inverse Function:** If f is bijective, then there exists f⁻¹: Y → X such that f⁻¹ ∘ f = idₓ and f ∘ f⁻¹ = id_Y

**Important Identification:** |𝒫(A)| = |{0,1}ᴬ| = 2^{|A|}

## 4. Mathematical Induction

### 4.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction
To prove that a statement A(n) holds for all n ∈ ℕ:

1. **Base Case:** Prove A(1) is true
2. **Inductive Step:** Prove that if A(n) is true (induction hypothesis), then A(n+1) is true

**Variants:**
- **Starting from 0:** Base case A(0), same inductive step
- **Strong Induction:** Assume A(m) for all m ≤ n, prove A(n+1)

### 4.2 Important Formulas Proved by Induction
- **Sum of First n Natural Numbers:** ∑_{k=1}ⁿ k = n(n+1)/2
- **Geometric Series:** ∑_{k=0}ⁿ qᵏ = (1 - qⁿ⁺¹)/(1 - q) for q ≠ 1
- **Binomial Theorem:** (x + y)ⁿ = ∑_{k=0}ⁿ (ⁿₖ) xⁿ⁻ᵏ yᵏ

### 4.3 Recursive Definitions
The **Recursion Theorem** guarantees that given:
- A set A
- An element x ∈ A 
- Functions fₙ: Aⁿ → A for each n ∈ ℕ

There exists a **unique** sequence (xₙ) with:
- x₁ = x
- xₙ₊₁ = fₙ(x₁, ..., xₙ)

**Examples:**
- **Factorial:** 0! = 1, (n+1)! = (n+1) · n!
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, Fₙ₊₁ = Fₙ + Fₙ₋₁
- **Arithmetic Sequence:** a₁ = a, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + d
- **Geometric Sequence:** x₁ = a, xₙ₊₁ = xₙ · q

## 5. Sum and Product Notation

### 5.1 Summation Symbol (Σ)
∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ = a₁ + a₂ + ⋯ + aₙ

**Rules:**
- ∑_{i=1}ⁿ (λaᵢ + μbᵢ) = λ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ + μ∑_{i=1}ⁿ bᵢ
- ∑_{i=1}ⁿ 1 = n
- ∑_{i=1}ⁿ c = n · c (for constant c)
- ∑_{i=1}ⁿ (aᵢ + bᵢ) = ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ bᵢ

For indexed families: ∑_{i∈I} aᵢ = ∑_{j=1}ⁿ a_{φ(j)} where φ: {1,...,n} → I is bijective

### 5.2 Product Symbol (Π)
∏_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ = a₁ · a₂ · ⋯ · aₙ

**Special values:**
- ∑_{i∈∅} aᵢ = 0
- ∏_{i∈∅} aᵢ = 1

## 6. Binomial Coefficients

### 6.1 Definitions
For n, k ∈ ℕ₀ with 0 ≤ k ≤ n:
(ⁿₖ) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)

For α ∈ ℂ and k ∈ ℕ₀:
(α₀) = 1, (αₖ) = α(α-1)⋯(α-k+1)/k! = ∏_{j=1}ᵏ (α+1-j)/j

### 6.2 Properties
- (ⁿ₀) = (ⁿₙ) = 1
- (ⁿₖ) = (ⁿₙ₋ₖ)
- (ⁿ⁺¹ₖ) = (ⁿₖ₋₁) + (ⁿₖ) (Pascal's Identity)
- ∑_{k=0}ⁿ (ⁿₖ) = 2ⁿ
- ∑_{k=0}ⁿ (ⁿₖ)(-1)ᵏ = 0 for n ≥ 1

### 6.3 Combinatorial Interpretation
(ⁿₖ) = number of k-element subsets of an n-element set = |𝒫ₖ({1,...,n})|

## 7. Cardinality and Infinite Sets

### 7.1 Basic Concepts
Two sets have the **same cardinality** if there exists a bijection between them.

- A set is **finite** if it has n elements for some n ∈ ℕ₀
- A set is **countably infinite** if it has the same cardinality as ℕ
- A set is **uncountably infinite** if it is infinite but not countably infinite
- A set is **countable** if it is finite or countably infinite

### 7.2 Important Results
- ℕ, ℤ, ℚ are countably infinite
- ℝ is uncountable (Cantor's diagonal argument)
- For any set A, |𝒫(A)| > |A| (Cantor's theorem)
- The union of countably many countable sets is countable
- Every subset of ℕ is countable
- A is countable ⇔ there exists an injection f: A → ℕ ⇔ there exists a surjection g: ℕ → A

### 7.3 Properties of Finite Sets
If A is finite with |A| = n:
- If B ⊆ A with A ≠ B, then B is finite with |B| < n
- If a ∈ A, then |A \ {a}| = n - 1
- For f: A → B with |A| = |B| = n: f is injective ⇔ f is surjective ⇔ f is bijective
