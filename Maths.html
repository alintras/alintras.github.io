    The task of <i>mathematics</i> is to establish truth or falsehood 
    of (formalizable) statements using rigorous logic, 
    and to provide methods for the solution of classes of problems.<br>
    Ideally, including rigorous proofs verifiying the validity to the methods.

    <h2>1.1 Historical Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Early history in Babylon (modern-day Iraq) and Egypt:</h3>
        <p><i>Babylonians (around 2000 BCE):</i> Systems of equations were solved approximately.<br>
        With <em>a,b</em> given, the goal was to find <em>x,y</em>:</p>
        \[
        \left.
        \begin{aligned}
        x + y &= a \\
        x \cdot y &= b
        \end{aligned}
        \right\}
        \implies x^2 - a x + b = 0
        \]
        <p>This corresponds to solving quadratic equations, but with restrictions:<br>
        no irrational numbers, no negative numvers, only first approximations.</p>

    <h3>Egyptians (around 1700 BCE):</h3>
        <p>Linear equations of the form:</p>
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
        x + a \cdot x &= b
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
        x + c \cdot x + d \cdot x &= e
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        <p>(with <em>a,b,c,d,e</em> given, solving for <em>x</em>) were solved using geometric methods.</p>

    <h3>Peak of developement in ancient Greece:</h3>

    <h3>Pythagoreans (around 600 BCE):</h3>
        <p>Discovery of incommensurable lengths and therefore irrational numbers by <em>Hippasus of Metapontum.</em></p>

    <h3>Euclid (around 300 BCE):</h3>
        <p>Wrote the 13 books of the <em>Elements</em>.<br>
        This remained the standard work in geometry and arithmetic until the 19th century 
        (and was the second most widely distributed book after the Bible).<br> 
        Euclid is credited with proving the irrationality of √2.</p>

    <h3>Diophantus (between 100 BCE and 300 CE):</h3>
    <p>Wrote the 13 books of <em>Arithmetica</em>, of which only six survive<br>
    He seperated arithmetic and algebra from geometry.</p>

    <h3>Further development:</h3>
    <p>Mathematics advanced in the Arab-Persian and Indian worlds, peaking in the 7th - 9th centuries.</p>

    <h3>Modern developement:</h3>
    <p>It was only during the Renaissance in 16th-century Italy that mathematics
        (and all other sciences) developed further in Europe.<br>
        From the 18th centuryonwards , influential mathematicians such as 
        <strong>Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, Galois, Abel, 
        Jordan Hölder, Lie, Killing, Carta, Grassmann, Hamilton, 
        Clifford, Cauchy, Ricci</strong> and <strong>Levi-Civita</strong>
        shaped its further developement.

    <h2>1.2 Euclidean Mathematics</h2>
    <p>In ancient Greece (represented partcularly by <em>Euclid</em>), numbers and
    arithmetic operations were based on <em>geometric intuition</em>.<br>
    Mathematical proofs were carried out using geometry.<br>
    We will consider a proof of the <em>irrationality</em> of √2.

    <section id="incommensurability">
        <h3>1.2.1 Definition of Incommensurability:</h3>
        <p>Two line segments are called <em>incommensurable</em> if the have no common measure.<br>
        They are called <em>commensurable</em> if they share a common measure.<br>
        If two line segments have a common measure, then they have a <em>greates common measure</em>, which is unique.<br>
        <em>Proof: antanairesis / Euclidean algorithm</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="gcd">
        <h3>1.2.2 Definition of GCD:</h3>
        <p>The greatest common measure of two natural numbers is the GCD (greatest common divisor).<br>
        The <em>Euclidean Algorithm</em> for constructing the greatest common measure 
        is the so-called <em>antanairesis</em> (<em>method of reciprocal or succesive subtraction</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Let <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> be two line segments.<br>
            Without loss of generality, let <i>Y ≤ X</i>.<br>
            To find their common measure (or for a natural number <i>X, Y</i>, their GCD),<br>
            we repeatedly subtract <i>Y</i> from <i>X</i> 
            until a remainder <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> remains, <i>0 ≤ r<sub>1</sub> &lt; Y</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If <i>r<sub>1</sub> = 0</i>, then <i>Y = gcd(X,Y)</i>.<br>
            If <i>r<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0</i>, subtract <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> from <i>Y</i> until a remainder <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> remains, <i>0 ≤ r<sub>2</sub> &lt; Y</i>.<br>
            If <i>r<sub>2</sub> = 0</i>, then <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>gcd(X,Y)</i>.<br>
            If <i>r<sub>2</sub> &gt; 0</i>, subtract <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> from <i>r<sub>1</sub> until a remainder <i>r<sub>3</sub></i> remains, and so on.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, we obtain the following system of equations 
            (with <i>n<sub>i</sub> ∈ ℕ for all i = 0,...,k</i> and <i> Y = r<sub>0</sub></i>):
        </p>
        <p align="center"><i>
            X = n<sub>0</sub>Y + r<sub>1</sub><br>
            Y = n<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub><br>
            r<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub> + r<sub>3</sub><br>
            </i>⋮<br>
            <i>r<sub>k-1</sub> = n<sub>k</sub>r<sub>k</sub> + r<sub>k+1</sub>
        </i></p>
        <p>If <i>r<sub>k+1</sub> = 0 &rArr; r<sub>k</sub> = gcd(X,Y)</i></p>

        <p>The process of successive subtraction provides a unique characterization of the ratio
            <i>X/Y</i> through the natural numbers <i>n<sub>0</sub>, n<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>k</sub>:</i>
        </p>
        <div align="center">
            $$\frac{X}{Y} = n_0 + \frac{r_1}{Y} = n_0 + \frac{1}{\frac{Y}{r_1}} = 
            n_0 + \frac{1}{n_1 + \frac{r_2}{r_1}} = 
            n_0 + \frac{1}{n_1 + \frac{1}{n_2 + \frac{r_3}{r_2}}} =
            ... = n_0 + \frac{1}{n_1 + \frac{1}{n_2 + \frac{1}{... + \frac{1}{n_k}}}}$$
        </div>
        <p>If the continued fraction terminates, <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are commensurable.<br>
        If it does not, they are incommensurable.

    <section id="irrationals">
        <h3>1.2.3 Definition of Irrational Numbers:</h3>
        <p>The ratio of two incommensurable line segments is called and <em>irrational number</em>, <br>
        the ratio of two commensurable line segments is called a <em>rational number</em>.</p>
    </section>
    <p><b>Example: </b>Continued fraction representation of \(\frac{5}{3}\) and \(\gcd(5, 3)\):</p>
    <p>
        $$5 = 1 \cdot 3 + 2$$
        $$3 = 1 \cdot 2 + 1$$
        $$2 = 2 \cdot 2 + 0$$
        <br>
        &rArr; \(\frac{5}{3} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2}}\)
    </p>
    <p>Next, we consider the proof of the incommensurability of the side and diagonal of a square.<br>
    From this follows the irrationality of √2.</p>

<section id="square-diagonal">
    <h3>1.2.4 Theorem of Diagonal of a Square:</h3>
    <p>
        <i>The side and diagonal of a square are incommensurable.</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>Proof:</i><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Start with a square of side \( a \) and diagonal \( d \).</li>  
        <li>Place \( a \) along \( d \);<br>
            a small remainder \( a_1 \) remains, so \( d = a + a_1 \).  
        <li>This leftover \( a_1 \) forms the side of a smaller square with diagonal \( d_1 \),  
        where \( a = a_1 + d_1 \).</li>
        <li>Repeating the process — placing \( a_1 \) along \( d_1 \) — leaves another remainder \( a_2 \),  
        so \( a = 2a_1 + a_2 \).</li>
        </ol>  
        Each step creates a new, smaller square, and the subtraction never ends.  
        Therefore, the side and diagonal are <b>incommensurable</b>.

        <p>By a <em>statement</em> or <em>proposition</em> we mean any sentence (any sequence of symbols) that can

        i.e. a value of either <em>true</em>, abbreviated T, or <em>false</em>, abbreviated F.</p>

            <li>Every animal is a dog. (F)</li>

        <p><b>x + 1 > 0</b> is not a statement as it can not be said to be either true or false without further knowledge on x.<br>
        <b>"All natural numbers are green"</b> is not a statement as it lacks any meaning.
