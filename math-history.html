        <h2>Early history in Babylon (modern-day Iraq) and Egypt:</h2>
            <p><i>Babylonians (around 2000 BCE):</i> Systems of equations were solved approximately.<br>
            With <em>a,b</em> given, the goal was to find <em>x,y</em>:</p>
            \[
            \left.
            \begin{aligned}
            x + y &= a \\
            x \cdot y &= b
            \end{aligned}
            \right\}
            \implies x^2 - a x + b = 0
            \]
            <p>This corresponds to solving quadratic equations, but with restrictions:<br>
            no irrational numbers, no negative numvers, only first approximations.</p>
    
        <h3>Egyptians (around 1700 BCE):</h3>
            <p>Linear equations of the form:</p>
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            x + a \cdot x &= b
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            x + c \cdot x + d \cdot x &= e
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            <p>(with <em>a,b,c,d,e</em> given, solving for <em>x</em>) were solved using geometric methods.</p>
    
        <h2>Peak of developement in ancient Greece:</h2>
    
        <h3>Pythagoreans (around 600 BCE):</h3>
            <p>Discovery of incommensurable lengths and therefore irrational numbers by <em>Hippasus of Metapontum.</em></p>
    
        <h3>Euclid (around 300 BCE):</h3>
            <p>Wrote the 13 books of the <em>Elements</em>.<br>
            This remained the standard work in geometry and arithmetic until the 19th century 
            (and was the second most widely distributed book after the Bible).<br> 
            Euclid is credited with proving the irrationality of √2.</p>
    
        <h3>Diophantus (between 100 BCE and 300 CE):</h3>
        <p>Wrote the 13 books of <em>Arithmetica</em>, of which only six survive<br>
        He seperated arithmetic and algebra from geometry.</p>
    
        <h2>Further development:</h2>
        <p>Mathematics advanced in the Arab-Persian and Indian worlds, peaking in the 7th - 9th centuries.</p>
    
        <h2>Modern developement:</h2>
        <p>It was only during the Renaissance in 16th-century Italy that mathematics
            (and all other sciences) developed further in Europe.<br>
            From the 18th centuryonwards , influential mathematicians such as 
            <strong>Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, Galois, Abel, 
            Jordan Hölder, Lie, Killing, Carta, Grassmann, Hamilton, 
            Clifford, Cauchy, Ricci</strong> and <strong>Levi-Civita</strong>
            shaped its further developement.
