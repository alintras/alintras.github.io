                <p>Calculus, which is short for <em>infinitesimal calculus</em> 
                    usually understood to mean differential and integral calculus of 
                    real and complex numbers.</p>
                <p>More generally, calculus may refer to any method or system of
                    calculation guided by the sybolic manipulation of expressions.<br>
                    In that sense, calculus is the beginning part of the broader field of
                    mathematical analysis, the section of mathematics concerned with the notion of a limit and limits of functions.</p>
                <p>In modern mathematics, the objects under investigation are almost always <em>sets</em>.<br>
                    So one aims at deriving true statements about sets from other statements about sets known or assumed to be true.<br>
                    Such a derivation or proof means applying logical rules that guarantee the truth of the derived statement.</p>
