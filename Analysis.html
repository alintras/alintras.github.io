                <h3>1.1 Intro</h3>
                <p>Calculus, which is short for <em>infinitesimal calculus</em> 
                    usually understood to mean differential and integral calculus of 
                    real and complex numbers.</p>
                <p>More generally, calculus may refer to any method or system of
                    calculation guided by the sybolic manipulation of expressions.<br>
                    In that sense, calculus is the beginning part of the broader field of
                    mathematical analysis, the section of mathematics concerned with the notion of a limit and limits of functions.</p>
                <p>In modern mathematics, the objects under investigation are almost always <em>sets</em>.<br>
                    So one aims at deriving true statements about sets from other statements about sets known or assumed to be true.<br>
                    Such a derivation or proof means applying logical rules that guarantee the truth of the derived statement.</p>

                    <h4>Statements</h4>
                    <p>By a <em>statement</em> or <em>proposition</em> we mean any sentence (any sequence of symbols) that can 
                    reasonably be assigned a <em>truth value</em>.<br>
                    i.e. a value of either <em>true</em>, abbreviated T, or <em>false</em>, abbreviated F.</p>

                    <p>Sentences that are statements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every dog is an animal. (T)</li>
                        <li>Every animal is a dog. (F)</li>
                        <li>The number 4 is odd. (F)</li>
                        <li>2 + 3 = 5. (T)</li>
                        <li>√2 < 0. (F)</li>
                        <li>x + 1 > 0 holds for each natural number x. (T)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sentences that are <em>not</em> statements: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let's study calculus!</li>
                        <li>Who are you?</li>
                        <li>3 * 5 + 7.</li>
                        <li>x + 1 > 0.</li>
                        <li>All natural numbers are green.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>x + 1 > 0</b> is not a statement as it can not be said to be either true or false without further knowledge on x.<br>
                    <b>"All natural numbers are green"</b> is not a statement as it lacks any meaning. 
                    It would become a statement if give a definition of what it means for a natural number to be green.</p>
